Biochemistry-colors.sty defines the standard colors of biochemistry
for use with D.P. Carlisle's color-package and U. Kern's xcolor
(xcolor is loaded by Biochemistry-colors). They may be used by
authors (with \usepackage) or by package writers (with
\RequirePackage, e.g. to create Beamer color themes).

Colors include:
  - Shapely-colors for amino acids and nucleotides
  - CPK-Colors (Corey, Pauling and Koltun) of elements 		
  - Jmol-colors of elements, important isotopes and structures	
  - Glycopedia colors for sugars		

Biochemistry-colors.pdf provides a list of these colors with
components in rgb (hex, word, decimal) and hsl-format. The source
